4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,It says the President's assembling a cabinet
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,"And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!"
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,And that I'm already Senate-approved...
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,I just got home and now I'm headed up to New York

4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,Me in N.Y.C.
4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,Me in N.Y.C.
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,But who's waitin' for me when I step in the place?
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,"My friend James Madison, red in the face"
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,He grabs my arm and
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,I respond
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,"""What's goin' on?"""
4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,Aaa-ooo!
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,"Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation's very soul"
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,Can you get us out of the mess we're in?
4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,Aaa-ooo!
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,Hamilton's new financial plan is nothing less
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,Than government control
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,I've been fighting for the South alone
4,What'd I Miss,MADISON,Where have you been?
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,Uh... France

4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,On my way
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,Let's get to the bottom of this... 
4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,What did I miss?
4,What'd I Miss,ENSEMBLE,Ahhh ah!
4,What'd I Miss,WASHINGTON,"Mr. Jefferson, welcome home"
4,What'd I Miss,HAMILTON,Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton
4,What'd I Miss,WASHINGTON & ENSEMBLE,"Mr. Jefferson, welcome home"
4,What'd I Miss,COMPANY,"Mr. Jefferson, welcome home"
4,What'd I Miss,COMPANY,"Sir, you've been off in Paris for so long!"
4,What'd I Miss,JEFFERSON,So what did I miss?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you're here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"""Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."""
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,We fought for these ideals; we shouldn't settle for less
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"Don't act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote 'em"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON/MADISON,Oww
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,But Hamilton forgets
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,His plan would have the government assume state's debts
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,The very seat of government where Hamilton sits
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Not true!
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,If New York's in debt-
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,Don't tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,We create. You just wanna move our money around
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,This financial plan is an outrageous demand
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,Stand with me in the land of the free
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,And pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,"Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Thank you, Secretary Jefferson"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,CROWD,That's my alcohol!
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Secretary Hamilton, your response"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Would you like to join us, or stay mellow"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"If we assume the debts, the union gets"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"A new line of credit, a financial diuretic"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"""We plant seeds in the South. We create."""
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Yeah, keep ranting"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,We know who's really doing the planting
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"You think I'm frightened of you, man?"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,We almost died in the trench
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,While you were off getting high with the French
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Reticent-there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Sittin' there useless as two shits
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Where my shoe fits
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We'll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Sir!
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,A word
4,Cabinet Battle #1,MADISON,You don't have the votes
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON/MADISON,You don't have the votes
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,Aha-ha-ha ha!
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON/MADISON,You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes
4,Cabinet Battle #1,JEFFERSON,Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder
4,Cabinet Battle #1,MADISON,Why he even brings the thunder...
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,You wanna pull yourself together?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,You need the votes
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"No, you need to convince more folks"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Winning was easy, young man. Governing's harder"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,They're being intransigent
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,You have to find a compromise
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,"But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!"
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,Convince them otherwise
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,What happens if I don't get congressional approval?
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,I imagine they'll call for your removal
4,Cabinet Battle #1,HAMILTON,Sir-
4,Cabinet Battle #1,WASHINGTON,"Figure it out, Alexander. That's an order from your commander"
